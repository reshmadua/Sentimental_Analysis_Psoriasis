# Sentimental_Analysis_Psoriasis
Microblogging has become a useful tool to share everyday life events and news and to express 
opinions. As Twitter posts are short and frequently generated, they are a great source for 
providing public sentiments towards a specific topic which can be related to politics, 
healthcare or technological innovation. The use of Sentiment Analysis in healthcare can assist 
in understanding how individuals discuss and feel about themselves or people around them. 
The aim of our project is to analyse and understand the general sentiments of people around 
Psoriasis, the key topics people discuss positively and negatively about and the most popular 
Psoriasis drug companies.
